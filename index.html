      <dt>One of the most interesting experiences I have had would probably be a more recent thing. During my summer
        the front panel on my desktop had managed to break. My dad gave me a replacement cord for my power button,
        so when I arrived to the rental house i'm living in i decided to replace the power cord. However,
        I managed to accidently insert the power cable into the reset slot on the motherboard instead of the power
        cable slot, so when i tried to turn it on, it did not do anything. I realized my mistake so i moved the
        cable and tried turning it on again, and it made this loud *POP* sound. I freaked out, and called my dad
        up to ask him what i had done. He told me to unplug the power cable and plug it back in, and it worked again</dt>
